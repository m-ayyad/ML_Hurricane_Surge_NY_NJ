# What is this Repository about?
In this repo, I am sharing trained ML models to predict the maximum storm surge height including the effect of wind-generated waves at 57 stations along the New York and New Jersey coastlines. 
The stations names and their corresponding longitude and latitude are available in file "stations.csv".
There are two ML models for each station where the 
Any researcher can use this ML model

# The training data set
We used the training data set which is available in the Mendely data base "". The data set 

# What is the input to the ML trained model?
The input to these ML models are the Tropical Cyclone (TC) characteristics including the distance between the TC and the point of interest, maximum sustained wind speed, and.
These ML models work only for the specified stations along NY and NJ coastlines.
The longitude and latitutde of these stations along with the stations names are available in "stations.csv" file.

# What is the used ML model and the sorresponding hyper parameters?
After performing  fine tuning the hy

# Who can use thes ML models?
Anyone can download and use the trained ML model. You can use the ".py" file to learn how to use it.
